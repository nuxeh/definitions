  Platform-specific chunks for NVIDIA Jetson TX1

  Support for the Tegra platform is still being developed. A very recent kernel
  with some patches is currently required to get a fully accelerated graphics
  stack on this platform.

  - Currently the kernel is built from upstream linux-next, with downstream
    patches applied
  - The version of U-Boot built in this stratum supports SMP via PSCI, by
    copying device tree nodes from the downstream DTB. Currently only 4
    Cortex-A57 of the eight (big.LITTLE) CPU cores are enabled.
  - CPU and memory frequency scaling support is not yet developed
  - Some non-GPL firmware is currently built into the kernel
  - Some non-fatal kernel dumps on boot need fixing
  - Various non-essential driver probing issues (regulators, etc)

  Some things don't currently work:
  - SATA
  - SD
  - Hardware fan control

  Some hardware has not yet been tested:
  - GPU
  - WiFi/bluetooth
  - Camera module

  The downstream NVidia L4T 3.10.67 kernel does not build under Baserock since
  it appears to need a 32-bit cross-compiler
