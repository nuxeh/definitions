  Platform-specific chunks for NVIDIA Jetson TX1

  Support for the Tegra platform is still being developed. A very recent
  kernel with some patches is currently required to get a fully
  accelerated graphics stack on this platform. Note that the SATA and
  networking will not work unless you have flashed the bootloader on
  your board to the version of U-Boot built in this stratum. Also, the
  CPUs on the Jetson run at a slow speed with this version of Linux.
  - TODO Note on memory timing / SMP
